Unit 04: Breadboard Wiring and Usage
====================================

Practice: Breadboard Wiring
-------------------------

As you discovered in in the previous unit, a breadboard has a central
channel with lines of five connected points radiating outward from
each side of it and usually one or two long lines of connected points
along the edge. We can connect parts together by inserting their leads
into the points in the breadboard, using connected points for the
leads we want to connect.


Lab: Testing Parts on a Breadboard
----------------------------------

XXX Test switches on breadboard? Problem is, many of them are too
narrow (2-point pin spacing) to fit across the center channel.
