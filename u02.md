Unit 02: Measuring Resistance with a Multimeter
===============================================

Theory: Number Ranges
---------------------

Here is a short summary of the most commonly used [SI prefixes][SI] in
electronics:


| Prefix | Symbol | Multiplier | Value
| ------:|:------:| ---------- | -----------
| pico-  | p      | ✕ 10^-12   | 1/1,000,000,000,000
| nano-  | n      | ✕ 10^-9    | 1/1,000,000,000
| micro- | µ      | ✕ 10^-6    | 1/1,000,000
| mili-  | m      | ✕ 10^-3    | 1/1,000
| (none) |        | ✕ 10^0     | 1
| kilo-  | k      | ✕ 10^3     | 1000
| mega-  | m      | ✕ 10^6     | 1,000,000


The symbols are sometimes used in the middle of a value to represent
both the symbol and the decimal point. Examples: 2k5 or 2K5 = 2,500;
12M = 12,000,000. Resistor values are often specified this way with an
"R" used when no symbol applies. Examples: when 100R = 100 Ω;  12R5 =
12.5 Ω.

Practice: Multimeters
---------------------

A **multimeter** is the standard tool for measuring voltage, current,
resistance and often other values. (A meter that measures only
resistance is called an "ohm meter" and one that measures resistance
and voltage is called a "volt" meter. These are both now quite rare.)
In this practice section we will discuss resistance measurements only,
but many of the things we learn apply to other measurements as well.

Multimeters come in two types: **manual ranging** and **autoranging**.
The former have specific ranges that must be manually set,
e.g., 10 kΩ - 20 MΩ or 1 mV - 6 V. Values outside this range will
display as "OL" (overload) or sometimes a "1" alone at the left of the
display. It's always best to avoid overloading any meter measuring
voltage or current as that can damage some meters, though resistance
"overloads" are harmless. (You'll learn more about this later.)
Autoranging meters have only one setting, usually marked "Ω", for
resistance measurements and have only one or two settings for other
measurements. (There might, for example, be two voltage and three
current ranges even on an autoranging multimeter.)

For various reasons understanding how ranges work is necessary even
with an autoranging meter. Because of this, it's easiest for beginners
to start out with a manual range meter, which is what we do in this
course. However, if you have only an auto-ranging meter with no manual
ranging mode you'll still be able to do most of the lab exercises with
it.

Digital meters have four digits for displaying the value, but the
left-most digit does not cover the full range from 0 to 9. The most
common type of meter is a 2000 count meter where the leftmost digit
will be only 0 or 1, giving a display range of 0-1999. The next most
common is a 6000 count meter where the left digit ranges from 0 to 5,
giving a value range of 0-5999 in the display. 4000 count is another
common value. (Though higher counts allow a meter to be more accurate,
there are plenty of 6000 count meters that are less accurate than a
good 2000 count meter. When worried about accuracy, do not assume what
you see on the display is really the exact value!)

In order to display values of more than, e.g., 1999 Ω or less than,
e.g., 000.1 V the display is scaled, either manually or automatically.
On an autoranging meter a decimal point will be displayed within the
digits and another part of the display will indicate the range using
an SI symbol,  e.g., 12.87 kΩ or 038.7 mV.

### Test Leads

Most multimeters use 4 mm **banana jacks** for the inputs; various
test leads, often called **probes**, are available. The standard set
of probes has long, pointy metal tips at the business end that you can
touch to any metal part of a circuit. You should also be supplied with
some other leads including ones with **alligator clips** (useful for
clipping to components when you need to use your hands for something
else), **test clips** which can be clipped to small wires or pins, and
bare wires that can be inserted into a breadboard. Use whichever
probes you find most convenient for the work you're doing;
electronically there is almost no difference between them.

### Multimeter Safety

We work mainly at low voltages where there's very little risk of
harming yourself. However, when using any electrical or electronic
test equipment, keep in mind the following guidelines:

1. Generally, don't probe things if you have no idea what they are, or
   if the circuit or device appears to be able to deliver a lot of
   energy (such as a wall outlet or a very large battery). When you do
   probe high-energy devices, make sure you're using a multimeter and
   probes designed for this.

2. Your skin has very high resistance, but the moist inside of your
   body does not. Avoid introducing any electricity though cuts or
   holes in your skin.

When in doubt, ask your instructor or someone else knowledgable about
electricity. ELV (Extremely Low Voltage) electronics projects of the
sort we work on in this course are extremely safe, but clever people
can always find a way to injure themselves.

There are also some further guidelines that are unlikely to result in
injury if you break them, but will help avoid damage to your test
equipment and parts:

1. Don't use settings on test equipment that you don't understand
   except under the guidance of an instructor. Multimeters have fuses
   in the current measurement sections that can be blown and this is
   annoying.

2. Don't try to measure the resistance of anything with a power source
   attached to it. Resistance measurements are for parts and unpowered
   circuits only. (We will learn why later in the course.)

3. Don't try to measure the resistance of anything that might be
   damaged by putting a small amount of electric current through it.
   (As we will later see, this is how a meter measures resistance.)


Lab: Measuring Resistance With a Multimeter
-------------------------------------------

1. Plug the test leads into your multimeter. The black lead goes into
   the jack marked "Common" or "COM" and the red lead goes into the
   jack marked with "Ω". (That jack may be marked other symbols, too.
   We will discuss the other symbols and use of the other jacks later
   in this course.)

2. Set your multimeter to measure resistance (Ω) in the maximum range
   (60 MΩ, 2 MΩ, whatever is the highest) and note the reading you get
   when the leads are not touching anything. Hold the tips of leads
   together tightly and note the new reading. Switch to lower ranges
   step by step, at each range noting the reading when you hold the
   leads together. At one or more of the lower ranges you should see a
   non-zero value; how do these values differ and what do they
   indicate?

3. Using your multimeter, measure and record the resistance it
   indicates for all of the resistors you used in Lab 1.1. How big is
   the difference between the nominal values as indicated by the color
   code and the actual values indicated by the meter? How big is the
   difference between different resistors of the same nominal value?
   Record the highest and lowest values you measured for each nominal
   value.

4. Your kit also includes some potentiometers. These have three
   terminals and a dial to change resistance values. Measure and
   record the resistance between each pair of terminals (1-2, 2-3,
   1-3) at various positions of the potentiometer dial. What can you
   conclude about how potentiometers work?

5. Pair up with a partner using a different brand or type of meter and
   compare your readings for the following. What do the results tell you?

    1. The probe tips held together at the lowest range.
    2. The same again with the leads swapped between the two multimeters.
    3. Readings for the same resistor, for various resistors of small
       and large values.

6. For each nominal resistance value in the class kit, determine the
   highest and lowest readings in the class for resistors of that
   nominal value. Calculate the actual tolerance range of the
   resistors in the class's sample. How does this compare to the
   nominal tolerance?

7. Measure the resistance of some other things and materials in the
   room, keeping in mind the warnings given above.

8. Borrow an auto-ranging meter and make a few measurements with it.
   How does it compare to using a manually ranging meter? Compare the
   time your manual and the auto-ranging meters take to measure large
   and small resistances.
