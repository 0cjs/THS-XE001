XE001: DC Electronics (Proposed Course)
=======================================

(XE001 is a temporary name until we're ready to assign a proper one.)

The current version of this is actually [THS XE001 Basic Electricity -
Student Handbook][xe-sh] and [Instructor Guide][xe-ig].

This repo is an experiment to see about moving that to Markdown,
some sort of LaTeX/MathML thing, and Kicad or whatever.
