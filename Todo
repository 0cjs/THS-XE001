README:
* Add links to THS website, forum, Gitter.im rooms for THS and this course

u01:
* Where do we mention AC current (even though we're not really dealing
  with it in this course?)
* Resistor Color Code table
* Better typesetting for exponents?
* E-numbers

u02: Measuring Resistance
* Move warnings someplace better?
* Warnings re Cat II+
* Warnings not to use ranges until you've learned about them.
* Hack up a graphite pencil for resistance measurements.

u03: Continuity
* Formatting?

u04:
* Where do we note that just testing the voltage of a battery with a
  meter is building a circuit, and of course every time you stick a
  meter into a circuit you're actually modifying that circuit?
